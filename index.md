I work as a Full-Stack Senior Data Scientist at The New York Times. I develop and deploy real-time machine learning (ML) models for subscription-related problems, such as serving a paywall at optimal moments or personalizing messages to drive subscriptions. Models I build are often constrained and multi-objective in nature, sitting atop causal machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms such as contextual bandits. I write statically-typed production code in Python and [Go](https://go.dev) and support model deployment as cloud-based containerized applications for high throughput inference. I have also built production-scale batch models that determined user-level access to Times content (see [this blog post](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-uses-machine-learning-to-make-its-paywall-smarter-e5771d5f46f8), [this PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CmS96K6-EE), or this [media article by VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-machine-learning-helps-the-new-york-times-power-its-paywall/)). See my [CV](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/rohit_supekar.pdf) for more details.

At the Times, I have applied causal inference to observational data using statistical matching techniques. I am also involved in designing and launching Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) to collect data for training causal ML models. During an internship at Amazon in 2020, I built a Double (De-Biased) machine learning model to estimate the causal impact of Advertising products.

I obtained a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2021, advised by [Prof. JÃ¶rn Dunkel](https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/). My [thesis](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/phd_thesis.pdf) combined ideas from scientific machine learning, mathematical modeling of active matter, and numerical computation. I built a computational inference framework to learn continuum models from microscopic data to predict collective phenomena in systems such as bacterial suspensions or self-propelled colloidal particles. I was a recipient of the [Mathworks Engineering Fellowship](https://engineering.mit.edu/2021-mathworks-fellows/page/2/). I also received a Master's degree from MIT for my work on theoretical and experimental modeling of [oceanic internal waves](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/sm_thesis.pdf). During my time at MIT, I enjoyed teaching and was a teaching assistant for [Advanced Fluid Mechanics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-25-advanced-fluid-mechanics-fall-2013/) (1 semester) and [Dynamics and Controls](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-003j-dynamics-and-control-i-spring-2007/.) (4 semesters).

In 2015, I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras, India. I worked with [Mahesh Panchagnula](https://home.iitm.ac.in/mvp/) on [theoretical fluid dynamics research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6654) and spent a year building an omni-directional robot for the [ABU Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) competition to [solve pick-and-place tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6jNqmd_Jek) (that's me driving the robot!).
