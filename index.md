I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at The New York Times. In my full-stack role, I develop and deploy machine learning models for subscription-related problems, such as serving a paywall at optimal subscription moments or personalizing messages to drive subscriptions. These real-time models are based on causal machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms such as contextual bandits, and are often constrained multi-objective optimization problems. I write statically-typed production-grade code in Python and Go to deploy these models as containerized applications in the cloud that can perform high throughput inference. My early work at the company also involved building production-scale batch models that determined user-level access to Times content (see [this blog post](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-uses-machine-learning-to-make-its-paywall-smarter-e5771d5f46f8), [this PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CmS96K6-EE), or this [media article by VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-machine-learning-helps-the-new-york-times-power-its-paywall/)). See my [CV](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/rohit_supekar.pdf) for more details.

I have also worked on applying causal inference to observational data using statistical matching techniques as well as designing Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). During an internship at Amazon in 2020, I built a Double (De-Biased) machine learning model to estimate the causal impact of Advertising products.

I obtained a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I was fortunate to be advised by [JÃ¶rn Dunkel](https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/). My [thesis](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/phd_thesis.pdf) combined ideas from scientific machine learning, active fluid dynamics, and applied mathematics. I built a computational inference framework to learn macroscopic continuum models based on microscopic data to model collective phenomena in systems such as backterial suspensions or a collection of micro-robots. I was a recipient of the [Mathworks Engineering Fellowship](https://engineering.mit.edu/2021-mathworks-fellows/page/2/). I also received a Master's degree from MIT for my work on theoretical and experimental modeling of [oceanic internal waves](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/sm_thesis.pdf). 

I spent four formative years at IIT Madras, India pursuing a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering. I worked with [Mahesh Panchagnula](https://home.iitm.ac.in/mvp/) on [theoretical fluid dynamics research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6654) and spent a year building an omni-directional robot for the [ABU Robocon competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon)to [solve pick-and-place tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6jNqmd_Jek) (yes, that's me driving the robot!).
