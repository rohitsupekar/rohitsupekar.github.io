I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at The New York Times. As a full-stack data scientist, I develop and deploy machine learning models for subscription-related problems, such as serving a paywall at optimal subscription moments or personalizing messages to drive subscriptions. These real-time models are based on causal machine learning and reinforcement learning such as contextual bandits. I write production-grade code in Go and Python to deploy these models in containerized applications. My early work at the company also involved building production-scale batch models that determined user-level access to Times content (see [this blog post](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-uses-machine-learning-to-make-its-paywall-smarter-e5771d5f46f8) or [this PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CmS96K6-EE)).

A part of my current work also involves using causal inference as applied to observational data or designing Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). During an internship at Amazon in 2020, I built a Double (De-Biased) machine learning model to estimate the causal impact of Advertising products from

I obtained a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I was fortunate to be advised by [JÃ¶rn Dunkel](https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/). My [thesis](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/phd_thesis.pdf) combined ideas from scientific machine learning, active fluid dynamics, and applied mathematics. I built a computational framework can learn macroscopic continuum models based on microscopic data to model collective phenomena that can be observed in systems such as backterial suspensions or a collection of micro-robots. I was a recipient of the [Mathworks Engineering Fellowship](https://engineering.mit.edu/2021-mathworks-fellows/page/2/). I also received a Master's degree from MIT for my work on theoretical and experimental modeling of [oceanic internal waves](https://rohitsupekar.github.io/assets/sm_thesis.pdf). 

I spent four formative years at IIT Madras, India pursuing a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering. I worked with [Mahesh Panchagnula](https://home.iitm.ac.in/mvp/) on [theoretical fluid dyanmics research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6654) and spent a year building an omni-directional robot to [solve pick-and-place tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6jNqmd_Jek) for the [ABU Robocon competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon).
